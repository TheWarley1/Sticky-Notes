# Sticky-Notes
12am 8/8/23

This a responsive sticky notes site i built using html, css(tailwind) and javascript.
###
I hit a blocker with the responsiveness but figured it out for the most part.
###
for the modal, i used information and code i got from w3schools and chat gpt to achieve desired result.

For some reason, I've been delaying updating my readme.
I had a long inner monologue on if journaling with my readme was cool. even took time to read about writing a good readme.
I arrived at the conclusion that I'm not building for a anything formal at the moment so, journaling may not be bad also I use it as a way to document my dev journey.
I also concluded that it is best to give a description of the project first then i can get to the journaling after.
finally, I have come to appreciate tailwind. i could imagine myself still stuck on this if i was using vanilla css.
My only set back with tailwind is the bulky use of classes tho.
as for my next project. i dont know yet. I'd probably use frontend mentor.
also i need to proceed to js soon.
